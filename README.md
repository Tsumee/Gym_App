A Java Development Kit (JDK), which provides the compiler and runtime environment for Java applications. You can download the latest version of JDK from here.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or NetBeans, which provides a graphical user interface for writing, debugging, and testing Java code. You can download Eclipse from here or NetBeans from here.
A MySQL database server, which stores the data for the gym app, such as members, packages, payments, and attendance. You can download MySQL from here.
A JDBC driver, which enables Java to communicate with MySQL. You can download the MySQL Connector/J from [here].
A Swing library, which provides the graphical components for the user interface of the gym app, such as buttons, labels, text fields, and tables. Swing is included in the JDK, so you do not need to install it separately.
